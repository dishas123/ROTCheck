# Carrot Classifier

The **Carrot Classifier** is a machine learning-based web application that classifies images of carrots, determining whether they are suitable for packaging or not. This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to process the images and make predictions. Users can upload carrot images via a simple web interface, and the application will return a classification based on the pre-trained model.

The goal of this project is to **automate the quality assurance process** for carrot packaging, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- **📸 Image Upload**: Users can upload images of carrots.
- **⚡ Real-time Classification**: The machine learning model processes the image and returns a classification.
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Built using **Flask**, providing an easy-to-use interface.
- **🎯 Model Accuracy**: Trained on a dataset of carrot images to ensure accuracy in predictions.
- **💬 User Feedback**: Users can submit feedback on the classification result, helping to improve future iterations of the model.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow (CNN Model)

## 🌱 How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser (`http://localhost:5000`).
2. Upload an image of a carrot.
3. The model will classify whether the carrot is suitable for packaging or not.
4. View the result instantly on the page.
